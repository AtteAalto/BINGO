# BINGO

This is the code for BINGO (Bayesian Inference of Networks with Gaussian prOcess dynamical models), a method for gene 
regulatory network inference from time series data. It is introduced in the article

A. Aalto, L. Viitasaari, P. Ilmonen, L. Mombaerts and J. Goncalves. "Continuous time Gaussian process dynamical models
in gene regulatory network inference", [arXiv:1808.09161](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08161), 2018.

Please cite the article if you use the method in your project. Further instructions on the method can be found in the 
file readme_BINGO.
